        "Well, quite a glittering assemblage, King Stefan.
        Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and â€¦ how quaint.
        Even the rabble. I really felt quite distressed at not receiving an invitation."

        "Slave in the magic mirror, come from the farthest space, through wind and darkness I summon thee.
        Speak! Let me see thy face. Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness.
        Change my queenly raiment to a peddler's cloak. Mummy dust, to make me old.
        To shroud my clothes, the black of night. To age my voice, an old hag's cackle. To whiten my hair, a scream of fright. A blast of wind to fan my hate. A thunderbolt to mix it well. Now, begin thy magic spell.
        Dip the apple in the brew. Let the Sleeping Death seep through. Look! On the skin! The symbol of what lies within. Now, turn red, to tempt Snow White, to make her hunger for a bite."

    <h2>Elvira the Mistress of the Dark</h2>
    <p>"Be yourself no matter what people say for if you were a perfect person you will still be judged by people.
        Mirror, mirror on the wall who's the most drop dead gorgeous one of all?
        That's ok. My appearance is kind of a shock to everybody.
        Until next time, unpleasant dreams...."
